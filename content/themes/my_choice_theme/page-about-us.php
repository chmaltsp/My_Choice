            <h3>History</h3>
            <p> Many people need assistance with activities of daily living and caring for their health due to a physical, intellectual or developmental disability or because of the increasing challenges that come with aging. Most long-term care is actually provided by family members, and many people pay privately for the care they receive. However there are many Wisconsin residents who need assistance and who cannot afford to pay for their care on their own.</p>

            <p>In 2000, the State of Wisconsin launched the Family Care program as a pilot program in 5 Wisconsin counties. Milwaukee County was one of the original 5 pilot counties.</p>
            <p>Now serving over 8,400 members in eight Wisconsin counties, the MCO has strengthened its commitment to the communities it serves and is now known as My Choice Family Care. A leader in providing the Family Care program in Wisconsin, My Choice Family Care is a robust and thriving operation now celebrating 15 years of successfully serving more than 21,722 Family Care members.
